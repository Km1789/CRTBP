Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem. Work report: "Construction and study of periodic orbits around the point ùêø1 Sun-Earth systems"

This report contains the main achievements in the work on constructing periodic orbits around the point L1 Sun-Earth systems.
The initial conditions of two periodic orbits bifurcating from a halo of orbits near the libration point were found
L1 of the Sun-Earth system. All constructed orbits were visualized and presented in this report. Stability analysis carried out
solutions and found the bifurcation points of this family
